# Comparison-of-Neural-Network-Classifiers
This is a project completed, submitted and graded as part of my Masters course. The aim of the project is to give you the experience of trying to develop a neural network classifier (or regressor), involving setting up a model, optimising the amount of regularisation, investigating its performance, and devising a new model.
